<h2 align="CENTER">Introduction</h2>
<p><b>Established in 1895, the Queensland Art Gallery has emerged as one
of the most innovative and dynamic visual arts centres in Australia. </b></p>
<p><b>The Gallery opened in its present premises in the Queensland Cultural
Centre, on the South Bank of the Brisbane River, in 1982. Architecturally
the Gallery is the most acclaimed building of its type in Australia, winning
the Royal Australian Institute of Architects special citation in 1982,
as well as other accolades. </b></p>
<p><b>These new and permanent premises, with superb modern facilities,
have allowed the creation of an expanded and more certain foundation for
the Gallery's Collection, its programs and the growth of its audience,
and has seen the Gallery develop into an institution of international standing.
</b></p>
<p><b>The Gallery's profile has been enhanced by greater emphasis on its
Collection, a diverse series of exhibitions, a comprehensive and lively
educational program and an extension services program which includes tours
to regional centres throughout Queensland. </b></p>
<p><b>The Gallery boasts one of the highest attendance rates of any Australian
Gallery. Queensland's rapidly expanding population combined with its ongoing
popularity as a tourist destination ensures the Gallery of even greater
future patronage.</b><br></p>
