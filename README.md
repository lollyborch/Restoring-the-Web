# Restoring-the-Web
DECO7180: Design Computing Studio 1 Project

Web Historians is a web app that highlights the importance of archived websites through an interactive educational experience. Targeted at high school IT students who are beginners in HTML, it allows users to update old website code to current web standards.

Users can create accounts, choose a website to restore, edit and validate HTML, save progress and view which modules of which websites they have worked on.
