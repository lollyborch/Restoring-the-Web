<p> They're just a bunch of hormonal time bombs. Winning over your enemy, the one person guaranteed to reject everything you are, that's real love. They've got those hoppy legs and twitchy little noses. This distress call wouldn't be taking place in someone's pants, would it? The lambs have passed through the gate.
