							<font size="1" face="arial, helvetica"><br><br> ALL-Australian football captain Wayne Carey has received a letter that he hopes will stamp out a vicious rumor about the star Kangaroo.			
						
							<font size="1" face="arial, helvetica"><br><br>
 The correspondence, from the Australian Sports Drug Agency, gives Carey a clean bill of health following a random drug test taken about a month ago.			
						
							<font size="1" face="arial, helvetica"><br><br>
 The all-clear arrived soon after Carey's manager, Ricky Nixon, had asked the AFL to release the drug-test results quickly to quell the rumors about the North Melbourne star forward.

							<font size="1" face="arial, helvetica"><br><br>
 Trott, football director and former best and fairest and Saints captain, said St Kilda must look to the future, and not dwell on the past, if it were to remain a viable Victorian-based club.			
						
							<font size="1" face="arial, helvetica"><br><br>
 'What irks me is seven people (standing as independents) are virtually saying the only reason they are standing is to keep St Kilda at Waverley,' Trott said.

							<font size="1" face="arial, helvetica"><br><br> THE draft format for a new VFL (circa 2000) is likely to contain some radical recommendations.			
						
							<font size="1" face="arial, helvetica"><br><br>
 Such as Monday night footy under lights from Whitten Oval; a team from Tasmania and one from Albury-Wodonga and with most AFL clubs wishing to have their Reserves included.			
						
							<font size="1" face="arial, helvetica"><br><br>
 Monday night footy! The AFL has backed away from that but I wonder whether another TV network could be interested in screening reserves matches between Collingwood and Carlton or between neighboring clubs such as St Kilda and Sandringham?

 A FIRM of St Kilda Rd headhunters has been commissioned by Geelong to find it a chief executive, and pronto.
